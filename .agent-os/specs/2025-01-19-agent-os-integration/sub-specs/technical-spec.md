# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-01-19-agent-os-integration/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Core Architecture
- Implement Strategy/Adapter pattern for prompt system selection
- Maintain strict separation of concerns between adapters
- Ensure zero impact on existing functionality
- Support lazy loading of adapters to minimize memory footprint
- Cache adapter instances per repository

### Interface Design
- `PromptSystemAdapter` interface must support all current prompt operations
- `PromptContext` must encapsulate all data needed by adapters
- `PromptSystemFactory` must handle adapter lifecycle management
- All interfaces must be fully typed with TypeScript

### Traditional Prompt Adapter
- Must wrap all existing prompt building methods without modification
- Preserve exact behavior including version tags and template loading
- Support all label-based prompt selection logic
- Maintain compatibility with custom prompt templates

### Agent OS Adapter
- Load and parse Agent OS config.yml files
- Support multiple instruction set paths
- Cache loaded instructions in memory
- Transform Linear webhook data to Agent OS context format
- Map Linear labels to Agent OS commands dynamically

### Configuration Schema
- Extend RepositoryConfig with optional promptSystem field
- Add comprehensive agentOsConfig structure
- Validate configuration at startup
- Provide clear error messages for misconfiguration

### Performance Requirements
- Adapter selection must complete in < 1ms
- Instruction loading must be done once and cached
- No synchronous file I/O in request path
- Memory usage increase < 10MB per repository

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback to traditional prompts on Agent OS errors
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Clear error messages in Linear comments on failures
- Retry logic for transient failures

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all new interfaces and classes
- Integration tests for both adapter implementations
- Performance benchmarks for adapter selection
- End-to-end tests with real Linear webhooks
- Backward compatibility test suite

## External Dependencies

- **js-yaml** - For parsing Agent OS config.yml files
- **Justification:** Agent OS uses YAML for configuration, need reliable parser

- **node-cache** - For in-memory instruction caching
- **Justification:** Efficient caching with TTL support for instruction sets
