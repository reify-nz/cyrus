# Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation plan for integrating Agent OS as an alternative prompt system in the edge-worker package. The implementation follows a test-driven development (TDD) approach with careful attention to maintaining backward compatibility.

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Create Adapter Pattern Foundation (Foundation Phase)
The first major task establishes the architectural foundation. Following TDD principles, we start by writing tests for the core interfaces before implementation. This includes creating the PromptSystemAdapter interface that both traditional and Agent OS systems will implement, along with the factory pattern for adapter creation.

### Task 2: Implement Traditional Prompt Adapter (Compatibility Phase)
This task wraps the existing prompt system in the new adapter pattern. By implementing this first, we ensure that all existing functionality continues to work unchanged. The adapter wraps existing methods like buildPromptV2, buildLabelBasedPrompt, and buildMentionPrompt without modifying their behavior.

### Task 3: Update EdgeWorker to Use Adapter Pattern (Integration Phase)
Here we modify the EdgeWorker class to use the adapter pattern instead of calling prompt methods directly. This is done incrementally, updating each webhook handler to use the appropriate adapter. Extensive testing ensures no regression in existing functionality.

### Task 4: Implement Agent OS Adapter (Feature Phase)
With the foundation in place and existing functionality preserved, we implement the Agent OS adapter. This includes loading Agent OS configurations, mapping Linear labels to Agent OS commands, and transforming Linear webhook data into Agent OS context format.

### Task 5: Integration Testing and Documentation (Validation Phase)
The final task ensures everything works together correctly. We create comprehensive integration tests, performance benchmarks, and documentation to help users adopt the new system.

## Key Implementation Decisions

1. **Adapter Pattern**: Chosen for clean separation between prompt systems and easy extensibility
2. **Lazy Loading**: Adapters are created on-demand to minimize memory usage
3. **Caching Strategy**: Agent OS instructions are loaded once and cached in memory
4. **Configuration First**: Simple configuration changes enable the feature without code modifications
5. **Gradual Migration**: Users can test Agent OS on specific repositories before full adoption

## Testing Strategy

Each task includes specific test sub-tasks following the pattern:
- Write tests first (TDD approach)
- Implement functionality
- Verify all tests pass

This ensures high code quality and catches regressions early.

## Risk Mitigation

The phased approach minimizes risk:
- Phase 1-3 refactor without changing behavior
- All existing tests must pass after each phase
- Agent OS implementation is isolated in Phase 4
- Comprehensive testing in Phase 5 before release

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve the task breakdown
2. Begin implementation with Task 1
3. Regular checkpoints after each major task
4. Performance validation before production deployment
