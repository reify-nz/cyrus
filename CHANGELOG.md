  - Implemented intelligent shell script detection supporting Windows (.ps1, .bat, .cmd) and Unix (.sh) scripts
  - Added graceful fallback for Windows users with Git Bash/WSL to still use bash scripts
  - Resolves "A subdirectory or file -p already exists" and "bash command not found" errors
- Resolved issue where Cyrus would fail to respond when it was initially delegated when the receiver was down

## [0.1.40] - 2025-08-10

### Added
- Customer subscription validation for Cyrus Pro users
  - Automatically checks subscription status when using the default proxy with a customer ID
  - Blocks access if subscription is expired, cancelled, or invalid
  - Shows appropriate messages for returning customers vs new customers
  - Validates subscription when setting customer ID via `cyrus set-customer-id` command
- Label-based repository routing - Route Linear issues to different git repositories based on their labels
  - New `routingLabels` configuration option allows specifying which labels should route to a specific repository
  - Useful when multiple repositories handle issues from the same Linear team (e.g., backend vs frontend repos)
  - Label routing takes precedence over team-based routing for more granular control

### Changed
- Updated Linear SDK from v54 to v55.1.0 to support Agent Activity Signals
  - Stop button in Linear UI now sends a deterministic `stop` signal that Cyrus responds to immediately
  - When you click the stop button while Cyrus is working, it will cleanly halt all operations and confirm the stop action
  - The stop signal implementation ensures no work continues after the stop is requested
- Updated Anthropic AI SDK from v0.57.0 to v0.59.0 and Claude Code from v1.0.61 to v1.0.72 for improved Claude integration

## [0.1.39] - 2025-08-08

### Changed
- Simplified initial setup by removing configuration prompts for MCP, labels, Linear teams, allowed tools, and workspace directory
  - MCP configuration is now optional with no default prompt
  - Allowed tools default to all standard tools plus Bash(git:*) and Bash(gh:*) for immediate productivity
  - Label-based system prompts now have defaults: "Bug" for debugger mode, "Feature,Improvement" for builder mode, and "PRD" for scoper mode
  - Team-based routing defaults to all workspace issues (no team filtering)
  - Workspace directory automatically uses `~/.cyrus/workspaces/<repo-name>`
  - Streamlined first-time user experience with sensible defaults

### Added

## [0.1.38] - 2025-08-06

### Added
- Native Linear attachments (like Sentry error links) are now included in the issue context sent to Claude
  - Cyrus now fetches attachments using Linear's native attachment API
  - Attachments appear in a dedicated "Linear Issue Links" section in the prompt
  - Particularly useful for Sentry error tracking links and other external integrations
- New command **`cyrus add-repository`** - Add a new repository configuration, thanks new contributor @Maxim-Filimonov !
- Attachment support for comments - Cyrus now downloads and provides access to attachments added in Linear comments
  - Attachments are automatically downloaded when users post comments with URLs or files
  - Downloaded to `~/.cyrus/<workspace>/attachments` directory
  - Attachment manifest is generated and included in Claude's prompt
  - Attachments directory is always available to Claude during sessions
- Differentiation between issue delegation and @ mentions for more focused responses
  - @ mentions now trigger focused responses without system prompts
  - Delegations continue to use full system prompts for comprehensive task handling
  - Aligns with Linear's expected agent activity behavior
- Subscription management built right into the CLI (because who wants another dashboard?)
  - `cyrus billing` - Opens your Stripe portal to manage subscription, payment methods, and download invoices
  - `cyrus set-customer-id` - Saves your customer ID after signup (copy-paste friendly)
  - Interactive prompt on startup if you're using our proxy without a subscription
  - Self-hosting option for the DIY crowd who prefer their own Linear app and infrastructure
  - existed in v0.1.34 but was missing since then

### Fixed
- Fixed attachments not being accessible to Claude during active streaming sessions
  - Pre-create attachments directory for every session to ensure future attachments are accessible
  - Always include attachments directory in allowedDirectories configuration
- Fixed issue where messages from @ Cyrus mention comments weren't being added to context
- Fixed issue where sub-issue base branches weren't being added to the user-prompt template, causing Cyrus to create PRs against the default branch instead

  - The outdated SDK was triggering excessive API calls leading to rate limit errors
  - Upgrading to v54 resolves these compatibility issues and restores normal operation

  - Shows "I've queued up your message as guidance" when Cyrus is still processing a previous request
  - Shows "Getting started on that..." when Cyrus is ready to process the new request immediately
- Parent branch inheritance for sub-issues - sub-issue branches now automatically use their parent issue's branch as the base instead of the default repository branch
  - Maintains proper Git hierarchy matching Linear's issue structure
  - Gracefully falls back to default base branch if parent branch doesn't exist
  - Clear logging shows branch inheritance decisions
- Model notification at thread initialization - Cyrus now announces which Claude model is being used (e.g., "Using model: claude-3-opus-20240229") when starting work on an issue

## [0.1.31] - 2025-07-09

### CLI
- cyrus-ai@0.1.31

### Added
- Work on multiple tasks within a single Linear issue - each comment thread maintains its own Claude session, letting you tackle different parts of a problem in parallel without context mixing. New root comments start focused sessions that see the full conversation history in a threaded view (just like Linear's UI) while concentrating on your specific request
- Automatic ngrok tunnel setup for external access
  - No more manual port forwarding or reverse proxy setup required
  - Cyrus will ask for your ngrok auth token on first run and handle the rest
  - Free ngrok account required (sorry, we can't make the internet work by magic alone)
  - Skip ngrok setup if you prefer to handle networking yourself
- Webhook debugging via `CYRUS_WEBHOOK_DEBUG=true` environment variable - see exactly what Linear is (or isn't) sending you

### Fixed
- Fresh startup no longer crashes with "EdgeWorker not initialized" error when trying to connect to Linear
- OAuth flow now works properly on first run (turns out asking for credentials before having a way to receive them was... problematic)

### Fixed
- Fixed webhook signature verification failures after restarting cyrus by extending edge worker registration TTL from 1 hour to 90 days
  - Resolves "Webhook signature verification failed for all registered handlers" error that occurred when cyrus was stopped and restarted
  - Edge worker registrations in the proxy now persist for 90 days instead of expiring after 1 hour

### Improved
- New comments on Linear issues queue up when Cyrus is already busy working, so that you can send multiple in a row ([#77](https://github.com/ceedaragents/cyrus/pull/77)) (now feed into existing Claude sessions instead of killing and restarting the session
